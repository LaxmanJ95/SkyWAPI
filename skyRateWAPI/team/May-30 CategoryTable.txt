) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=60 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (1,'Airframe','The airframe of an aircraft is its mechanical structure. It is typically considered to include fuselage, wings and undercarriage and exclude the propulsion system.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (2,'Engines','A jet engine is a reaction engine discharging a fast-moving jet that generates thrust by jet propulsion. This broad definition includes airbreathing jet engines (turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, and pulse jets) and non-airbreathing jet engines (such as rocket engines).');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (3,'Accessory','The accessory drive is a gearbox that forms part of a gas turbine engine.[1] Although not part of the engine\'s core, it drives the accessories, fuel pumps etc., that are otherwise essential for the operation of the engine or the aircraft on which it is mounted. Accessory drives on large engines handle between 400â€“500 hp.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (4,'Instrument','Flight instruments are the instruments in the cockpit of an aircraft that provide the pilot with information about the flight situation of that aircraft, such as altitude, airspeed and direction. ');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (5,'Radio','Airband or aircraft band is the name for a group of frequencies in the VHF radio spectrum allocated to radio communication in civil aviation, sometimes also referred to as VHF, or phonetically as \"Victor\". Different sections of the band are used for radionavigational aids and air traffic control.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (6,'Emergency Equip','Emergency equipment on just about any airline aircraft consists of the following: fire extinguishers, crash ax, megaphone(s), flashlights, first aid kits, life vests, escape ropes, protective breathing equipment (PBE), Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs), and for some - life rafts.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (7,'Fabric','Aircraft fabric covering is a term used for both the material used and the process of covering aircraft open structures. It is also used for reinforcing closed plywood structures, the de Havilland Mosquito being an example of this technique, and on the pioneering all-wood monocoque fuselages of certain World War I German aircraft like the LFG Roland C.II, in its wrapped Wickelrumpf plywood strip and fabric covering.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (8,'NDT','Our non-destructive testing (NDT) services will help you identify and analyze problems with your aircraft before they put you in danger. NDT inspections are typically carried out during production, regular scheduled maintenance and in the cause of unexpected events.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (9,'Floats','A floatplane (float plane or pontoon plane) is a type of seaplane, with one or more slender pontoons (known as \"floats\") mounted under the fuselage to provide buoyancy. By contrast, a flying boat uses its fuselage for buoyancy. Either type of seaplane may also have landing gear suitable for land, making the vehicle an amphibious aircraft.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (10,'Rotar Blades','A rotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft[1] is a heavier-than-air flying machine that uses lift generated by wings, called rotary wings or rotor blades, that revolve around a mast. Several rotor blades mounted on a single mast are referred to as a rotor. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines a rotorcraft as \"supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors\".[2] Rotorcraft generally include those aircraft where one or more rotors are required to provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as helicopters, cyclocopters, autogyros, and gyrodynes. ');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (11,'Landing Gear','Landing gear is the undercarriage of an aircraft or spacecraft and may be used for either takeoff or landing. For aircraft it is generally both.');
INSERT INTO `category` (`ID`,`CATEGORY`,`DESCRIPTION`) VALUES (12,'Propellers','An aircraft propeller, or airscrew,[1] converts rotary motion from an engine or other power source, into a swirling slipstream which pushes the propeller forwards or backwards. It comprises a rotating power-driven hub, to which are attached several radial airfoil-section blades such that the whole assembly rotates about a longitudinal axis. The blade pitch may be fixed, manually variable to a few set positions, or of the automatically-variable \"constant-speed\" type.');
